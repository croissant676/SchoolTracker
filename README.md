# School Tracker

---

This is a simple page designed to display the current
amount of time the fall semester.

The main file is `index.html`, but there's a legacy version
that required a ktor server to be run. This file uses JS
to calculate the percentage and hours every millisecond, compared
to the original server which required a refresh
to fetch accurate data.

This was a fun simple project. Hope you guys enjoy!

## TODO:
 - Make a version that only tracks school days.
